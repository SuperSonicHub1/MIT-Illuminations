# Illuminations by MIT

MIT Illuminations is a dynamic light installation at the MIT Welcome Center controlled by open-source code contributed by MIT students and the general public. See the lights in person by visiting the MIT Welcome Center at 292 Main Street in Cambridge, MA.

This open source application takes P5 code and visualizes/outputs it to various professional and hobbyist lighting units, making creating light shows easy and accessible.
